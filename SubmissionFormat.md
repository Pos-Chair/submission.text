I'm developing a project called: "Project name"

Hereâ€™s the elevator pitch: "A short tagline for the project"

It's built with: "Languages, hardware, APIs, hosts, libraries, UI kits, and frameworks"

The team: "Add here"

Here's the whole story: "##Inspiration. Refer to: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"

Try it out: "URL for demo site, app store listing, GitHub repo, etc."
