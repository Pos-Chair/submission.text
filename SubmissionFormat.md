## Pos-Chair

I'm developing a project called: "Pos-Chair"

Hereâ€™s the elevator pitch: "A short tagline for the project"

It's built with: "Languages, hardware, APIs, hosts, libraries, UI kits, and frameworks"

The team: "names here"

Here's the whole story: 
"##Inspiration. Refer to: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"

Pos-Chair is a seat cover that turns any chair into a 'smart chair' for correcting back posture. 

According to the NY Times article "Sit Up Straight. Your Back Thanks You," up to 80 percent of Americans experience back pain at some point in their lives, and each year 15 percent of all adults are treated for such problems as herniated discs, spinal stenosis or lumbar pain...Back pain is notoriously difficult, and expensive, to remedy.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/health/25consumer.html?_r=0

The Pos-Chair seat cover integrates force sensors to determine a person's weight distribution on the chair. It consists of muliple force sensors distributed strategically over the seat and back of the cover to monitor changes in sitting postures. Depending on the force distributions, the user will be able to monitor the quality of his/her posture through the real-time output on our Pos-Chair iOS app. The app was created with the Particle iOS Cloud SDK and communicates with a Particle Internet Button for rapid transfer of sensor information. We have also created a web application that provides a clean presentation of our product, and offers login service allowing users to view graphical real-time data from their Pos-Chair on the web as well as through our app.

Our inspiration for Pos-Chair comes from personal experiences and a need we see to decrease back pain associated with sitting long hours in the workforce. With Pos-Chair , people have access to the iOS app or web application which will notify them how to correct their sitting position. With practice, users can identify a correct sitting position, improve their posture longterm and decrease risk of pain and more serious back problems at a relatively low cost. Because Pos-Chair is a cover for a chair it can be used on any chair and is transportable. No sensors are attached to the person. Pos-Chair cover has application to help employees work better because with good back positioning they experience decreased discomfort and pain. As a team comprised of undergraduate and Ph.D students, we have identified application for Pos-Chair in any situation which requires the user to sit whether that be in a class lecture, at a research desk, at work, or at home.  

When people decide to use Pos-Chair, they are correcting their posture - reducing pain and risks such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis and lumbar pain - and improving their overall health with cutting edge technology at the forefront of ergonomics (LB feel free to re-word thiSSSSS!!).
